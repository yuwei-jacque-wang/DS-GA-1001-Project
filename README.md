# DS-GA 1001 Final Project 
## Default Prediction from Payment Behavior

This is a project for NYU DS-GA 1001 Introduction to Data Science class. <br>
This project contributes as an origianl approach for loan default prediction, especially prediction for default at a certain time, from payment behavior history. To check the origianl dataset please click [here](http://www.creditriskanalytics.net/datasets-private2.html)

This repository contains:

1. Original Data Set [mortgate.csv](https://github.com/yuwei-jacque-wang/DS-GA-1001-Project/blob/master/mortgage_csv.rar)
2. Preliminary Scripts for Exploration
3. Aggregated Data Sets for Model Training
4. Codes for Aggregating Data and Feature Engineering
5. Codes for Model Training, Evaluation and Comparison
6. A Final Report (PDF)
